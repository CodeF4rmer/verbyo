The sanctions lists identify parties who those governments or international bodies believe are engaged in illegal activities.

In order for us to be compliant with any new sanctions, there may be an impact on some groups of customers.  </p> <h2>H2 Why can I not get verified?</h2> <p>We want to keep ePayments safe and secure, and this includes making sure that we comply with all our legal and regulatory obligations, including those related to sanctions. We are pleased that most of our customers will not be impacted by the current sanctions, but as ever, if things change, we will keep you updated.</p>  <p>Thank you for understanding and be safe,</p>    </div>   </html>",
